Structure:
    
1. Parsing the file

    - parseDemo() function parses the demo data file
        return students, preferences, classes, times, professorOfClass, classrooms, sizes
        (right now we do not yet have classrooms and sizes file, to be added later)
    - parseExcel() function to be added, to parse the excel data

This function incurs cheap costs.

2. Constructing the data

    - construct(students, preferences, classes)
        return studentsInClass, overlap, classes
    
    After we load the data in by either parseDemo() or parseExcel(), we feed the 
    data into this construct function. The construct function takes inputs:
        students, preferences, classes, classrooms, sizesOfClassrooms, times
    and outputs:
        studentsInClass, overlap, classes, availableRoomsInTime
        
    The complexity of this function is O(k log k)+ O(w), which is the complexity to 
    process the data

3. Assign the Classes to times
    assignClassToTime(c,availableRoomsInTime,professorsInTime,classesInTime,studentsInClass,professorOfClass,times,overlap,classes)

To handle the starting element:
    
10:48 Fri: an easy way to handle the 0 position is just to have the time id and classes start
from 0. in reality you're converting the class numbers to numbers from 1 anyways. so why not.

BECAUSE when you keep an 0 in the front, sorting would be a big issue. including when you
are using zip. 


Parsing the Excels part hasn't been tested yet. The current code works for the demo data.
